# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS 

## HTML Text :

- Headings and paragraphs
- Bold, italic, emphasis
- Structural and semantic markup

*To implement such semantic mark up, HTML provides dedicated tags that you can use to represent such sections, for example:*

- header: < header>.
- navigation bar: < nav>.
- main content: < main>, with various content subsections  represented by < article>, < section>, and < div> elements.
- sidebar: < aside>; often placed inside < main>.
- footer: < footer>.

## CSS 

**What is CSS?**


- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
- CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
- CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
- External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

**Why Use CSS?**

CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

**CSS Selectors**


*CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.*

*We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:*

- Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
- Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
- Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
- Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

## JavaScript

**What is JavaScript :**

- JavaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

- JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.

- JavaScript is easy to learn


**What JavaScript can Do** :

- JavaScript Can Change HTML Content
- JavaScript Can Change HTML Attribute Values
- JavaScript Can Change HTML Styles (CSS)
- JavaScript Can Hide HTML Elements
- JavaScript Can Show HTML Elements

**JavaScript Display Possibilities**

*JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:*

- Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
- Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
- Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
- Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

**JavaScript Values**

*The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:*

-Fixed values ...Fixed values are called Literals.
-Variable values ...Variable values are called Variables.


**JavaScript Operators**

**JavaScript Arrays**

*JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable.*

**Decisions and Loops**

**DECISIONS**

*Using the results of evaluations, you can decide which path your script should go down.*


**LOOPS**

*There are also many occasions where you will want to perform the same set of steps repeatedly*



**Different Kinds of Loops**

- for - loops through a block of code a number of times
- for/in - loops through the properties of an object
- for/of - loops through the values of an iterable object
- while - loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true
- do/while - also loops through a block of code while a specified condition is true

**Comparison Operators**

**Conditional Statements**

*In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:*

- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
