# Images, Color, Text 

**Images**

*Images can improve the design and the appearance of a web page.*

**HTML Images Syntax**

- The HTML < img> tag is used to embed an image in a web page.

- Images are not technically inserted into a web page; images are linked to web pages. The < img> tag creates a holding space for the referenced image.

- The < img> tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.

- The < img> tag has two required attributes:

>   src - Specifies the path to the image

> alt - Specifies an alternate text for the image

**Syntax**

![image](/images/img.png)


**Edit Images**

*The height, width, align and float  properties are used to set the image*

**Animated GIFs**

*Animated GIFs show several frames of animage in sequence*

**additional Info**

- You should save images at the size you will be using
them on the web page and in the appropriate format.
-  Photographs are best saved as JPEGs; illustrations or
logos that use flat colors are better saved as GIFs.

## Color


**CSS Color Values**

*With CSS, colors can be specified in different ways:*

- By color names
- As RGB values
- As hexadecimal values
- As HSL values (CSS3)
- As HWB values (CSS4)
- With the currentcolor keyword

**RGB Colors**

*RGB color values are supported in all browsers.*

*An RGB color value is specified with: rgb( RED , GREEN , BLUE ).*

*Each parameter defines the intensity of the color as an integer between 0 and 255.*

**Example**

**CSS background-color Property**


![backgrounColor](/images/backcolor.png)

*The background of an element is the total size of the element, including padding and border (but not the margin).*

**CSS Opacity**

*The opacity property specifies the opacity/transparency of an element.*

*The opacity property can take a value from 0.0 - 1.0. The lower value, the more transparent:*


![opacity](/images/opacity.png)


> CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.

## Text

**Generic Font Families**

*In CSS there are five generic font families:*

1. Serif fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
2. Sans-serif fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
3. Monospace fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
4. Cursive fonts imitate human handwriting.
5. Fantasy fonts are decorative/playful fonts.

**Text-Decoration**

![Decoration](/images/deco.png)

**Definition and Usage**

*The text-decoration property specifies the decoration added to text, and is a shorthand property for:*

- text-decoration-line (required)
- text-decoration-color
- text-decoration-style

**Additional Info**

- If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are several options, but you need to have the right license to use them.

- You can control the space between lines of text, individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.

- You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or when they have visited a link.
