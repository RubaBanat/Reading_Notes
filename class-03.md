# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model


## Lists :

*HTML lists allow web developers to group a set of related items in lists.*

**Unordered HTML List**

*An unordered list starts with the < ul> tag. Each list item starts with the < li> tag.*

*The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default:*

**Ordered HTML List**

*An ordered list starts with the < ol> tag. Each list item starts with the < li> tag.*

*The list items will be marked with numbers by default:*

**HTML Defintion Lists**


*HTML also supports defintion lists.*


*The < dl> tag defines the defintion list, the < dt> tag defines the term (name), and the < dd> tag describes each term:*

## CSS


 **CSS Boxes**


*All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout.*

*The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content. The image below illustrates the box model:*


![boxes](/images/box.png)



- **Content** - The content of the box, where text and images appear
- **Padding** - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
- **Border** - A border that goes around the padding and content
- **Margin** - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent


**Border Images**

**The box-shadow**

*The box-shadow property defines the shadow of an element*

*Example*

*The Result*

## JavaScript


**Arrays in Java**


*An array is a group of like-typed variables that are referred to by a common name.*

**There are some important points about Java arrays.**

- In Java all arrays are dynamically allocated.
- Since arrays are objects in Java, we can find their length using the object property length. 
- A Java array variable can also be declared like other variables with [] after the data type.
- The variables in the array are ordered and each have an index beginning from 0.
- Java array can be also be used as a static field, a local variable or a method parameter.
- The size of an array must be specified by an int value and not long or short.

**Java Switch Statements**

*Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.*

**Syntax**

![Syntax](/images/switchSyntax.png)

This is how it works:

- The switch expression is evaluated once.
- The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
- If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
- The break and default keywords are optional.


**The break Keyword**

*When Java reaches a break keyword, it breaks out of the switch block.*

*This will stop the execution of more code and case testing inside the block.*

*When a match is found, and the job is done, it's time for a break. There is no need for more testing.*
