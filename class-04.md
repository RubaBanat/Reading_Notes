# HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout

## Links

*Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page.*

**HTML Links - Syntax**

*The HTML < a> tag defines a hyperlink. It has the following syntax:*

![linksSyntax](/images/links.png)



**Link to an Email Address**


![EmailSynatx](/images/emil.png)


**Opening Links in a New Window**


![target](/images/traget.png)



**Summary for all tags**

- Use the < a> element to define a link
- Use the href attribute to define the link address
- Use the target attribute to define where to open the linked document
- Use the < img> element (inside < a>) to use an image as a link
- Use the mailto: scheme inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program.


## LayOut

- < div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.


## JavaScript Functions

*A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.*

*A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).*

 **-Function Syntax**

*A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().*

*Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).*

*The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas: (parameter1, parameter2, ...)*

*The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}*


**The () Operator Invokes the Function**

*Using the example above, toCelsius refers to the function object, and toCelsius() refers to the function result.*

*Accessing a function without () will return the function object instead of the function result.*

**Functions Used as Variable Values**

*Functions can be used the same way as you use variables, in all types of formulas, assignments, and calculations*
