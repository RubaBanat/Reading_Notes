## LayOut

**Website Layout**

*A website is often divided into headers, menus, content and a footer:*

![layout](images/csslayout.png)




- < div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.
- Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
- The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
- Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
- Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
- Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
- CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
- You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
