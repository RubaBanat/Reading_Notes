# Debugging 

## Error Handling & Debugging

**Definition and Usage**

- The debugger statement stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function.

- Using the debugger statement has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the code.

- Normally, you activate debugging in your browser with the F12 key, and select "Console" in the debugger menu.

> **Note:** If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect.

**Syntax**

> debugger;
