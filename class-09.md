# JavaScript Events

> HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.

> When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.

**What can JavaScript Do?**

*Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:*

+ Things that should be done every time a page loads
+ Things that should be done when the page is closed
+ Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
+ Content that should be verified when a user inputs data

*Many different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:*

+ HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
+ HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
+ You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements
+ You can prevent events from being sent or being handled

**Event Flow**

- Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked).

- Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon.

- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function. When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user.

- You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element.

- The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events
