> *What I Learned from this interesting article is that a good team is the foundation for any high-performing business. Superficially, a thriving team looks very much like any other. However, it is what occurs unbeknown to a mere observer which separates a good team from the best team. The attitudes, the behaviours, the interactions, the language and the environment all add up to create a thriving team.*
