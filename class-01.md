# Introductory HTML and JavaScript

## What is HTML :

- HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.
- HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
- HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
- HTML consists of a series of elements.
- HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.
- HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

- HTML Tags :

Tags act like containers. They tell you
something about the information that lies
between their opening and closing tags.

*Basic Tags* :

2. Extra Markeup :

- Doctypes
Because there have been several versions of HTML, each webpage should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using
Browsers usually display the page even if DOCTYPE is not included
In this class, we are using HTML5, so we will include the DOCTYPE as < !DOCTYPE html> at the beginning of each file.

- Comments in HTML
< !-- comment goes here -->
Comments are useful to add notes for yourself, or to make a piece of code invisible to the user until you would like to add it

- ID Attribute 
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute .

- Class Attribute 
Every HTML element can carry a class attribute

- Block Elements
Examples of block elements are
< h1>, < p>, < ul>, and < li>
- Inline Elements
Examples of inline elements are
< a>, < b>, < em>, and < img>.

- Grouping Text & Elements in a Block
 < div >

- Grouping Text & Elements Inline
< span > < iframe > 
- Information About Your Pages
< meta >
- Escape Characters

- < header> - Defines a header for a document or a section
- < nav> - Defines a set of navigation links
- < section> - Defines a section in a document
- < article> - Defines an independent, self-contained content
- < aside> - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
- < footer> - Defines a footer for a document or a section
- < details> - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
- < summary> - Defines a heading for the < details> element

-  < figure> and < figcaption> - The < figure> tag specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.

The < figcaption> tag defines a caption for a < figure> element. The < figcaption> element can be placed as the first or as the last child of a < figure> element.
