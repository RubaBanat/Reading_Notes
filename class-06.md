*Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.*

**The this Keyword**

- In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

- In the example above, this is the person object that "owns" the fullName function.

- In other words, this.firstName means the firstName property of this object.



## Document Object Model :

*The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.*
